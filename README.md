# mux

**Switch between AI CLI sessions without breaking your flow.**

Running Claude in one session, Codex in another, and a dev server in a third? Switching between them means detaching, listing sessions, remembering which is which, and reattaching. mux eliminates that friction — see every session's live output at a glance, spot which AI tools are active, and switch in a keystroke.

## The Problem

In the age of AI-powered development, a typical workflow looks like:

- **Session 1**: Claude Code working on your feature
- **Session 2**: Codex reviewing your test suite
- **Session 3**: Dev server running your app
- **Session 4**: Another Claude session refactoring a different module

tmux's built-in `choose-session` shows you a list of names — but which session has Claude waiting for your input? Which one is still running? You end up cycling through sessions blindly.

## How mux solves it

### Live preview — every window and pane
See the actual terminal output of any session *before* you switch. Press `Tab` to expand a session into its windows, expand again to peek into individual panes — preview each one without attaching.

### AI CLI detection
`claude`, `codex`, `aider`, `gemini` are automatically detected and highlighted with badges — instantly find the right session.

### Git branch & worktree display
Each session shows its current git branch. Linked worktrees are visually distinguished so you can tell at a glance which sessions are working on isolated branches.

### Cost & token tracking
For Claude Code sessions, mux reads session logs to display real-time token usage and estimated cost — no configuration needed.

### Popup overlay
Press one key to summon mux on top of whatever you're doing — even mid-conversation with an AI CLI. Pick a session and you're there.

### Vim-style navigation
`j`/`k` to browse, `/` to filter, `Enter` to attach. No mouse needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-line interactive installer (recommended)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunemis/mux/main/install.sh | bash

# Or install manually
brew install lunemis/tap/mux   # or: go install github.com/lunemis/mux/cmd/mux@latest
mux                             # launch the session manager
```

For the best experience, set up popup mode (opens mux as a floating overlay):

```bash
mux setup-keybind               # binds prefix + m
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf   # reload config
```

Now press `Ctrl+b` then `m` anywhere in tmux to open mux.

## Installation

### Interactive installer (recommended)

The installer guides you through binary installation and keybinding setup:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunemis/mux/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install lunemis/tap/mux
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunemis/mux.git
cd mux
make install   # builds and installs to /usr/local/bin
```

### Go install

```bash
go install github.com/lunemis/mux/cmd/mux@latest
```

## Usage

### Basic

Run `mux` to open the session manager. Use `j`/`k` to navigate, `Enter` to attach, `q`/`Esc` to quit.

The left panel shows your sessions with AI badges and git branches. The right panel shows a **live preview** of the selected session's terminal output, updated every 500ms.

By default, `mux` automatically stacks the session list above the preview when the terminal is closer to 1:1 than 16:9, and switches back to side-by-side when it is closer to 16:9. Use `--layout` (or `-l`) to override it: `mux -l vertical` (or `mux -l v`) forces the stacked layout, `mux -l horizontal` (or `mux -l h`) forces side-by-side, and `mux -l auto` (or `mux -l a`) restores automatic layout.

### Popup mode (recommended)

Open mux as a floating overlay inside tmux — works even while AI CLIs are running in the foreground.

```bash
# Set up the keybinding (one-time)
mux setup-keybind          # prefix + m (default)
mux setup-keybind Space    # or use a different key

# Reload tmux config
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

You can also open the popup manually with `mux popup`.

> **Note:** Popup mode requires tmux 3.2+

### Statusbar widget

Show AI session icons in your tmux status bar without opening the TUI:

```bash
# Add to ~/.tmux.conf
set -g status-right '#(mux status)'
```

This runs `mux status` which outputs a compact summary like `✦ ◈` when AI sessions are active.

### Works with skimd

Pair with [skimd](https://github.com/lunemis/skimd) to review AI-generated markdown docs without leaving tmux.

- `prefix+m` → **mux** — switch sessions
- `prefix+v` → **skimd** — skim documents
